Their viewing habits include seeking out alternative news sources, independent journalism, and reports from organizations like Al Jazeera, Democracy Now!, or local Palestinian media, with a strong interest in real-time updates, geopolitical analyses, and coverage of protests or solidarity movements. They actively watch documentaries that explore the history of Palestine, the Nakba, the origins of the conflict, and the impact of Israeli policies on Palestinian life, always from a Palestinian perspective. They follow content from human rights organizations (e.g., Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, B'Tselem) and legal experts discussing international law, war crimes, and accountability related to the conflict. They engage with videos featuring personal stories, interviews, and testimonies from Palestinians living under occupation or in exile, aiming to understand the human impact of the conflict. They also look for content related to global solidarity movements, boycott, divestment, and sanctions (BDS) campaigns, and discussions on effective advocacy strategies. Furthermore, they consume academic and scholarly discussions, including lectures, panel discussions, and interviews with academics, historians, and political scientists who offer critical perspectives on Zionism, settler colonialism, and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. They would likely avoid or be highly critical of content that presents a solely pro-Israel narrative without acknowledging Palestinian perspectives, dehumanizes Palestinians or justifies actions that violate international law, or is produced by mainstream Western media outlets perceived as biased." --videos H7FML0wzJ6A S5zmzcOlNHU QUCeQt8zg5o ZV5ddewYMok 8xbkakrwmFo J8fFVsGoEcA v9_mzAzWnXA eaNFak3fbis hqeJqqJOSxk dJRiAVnBwo4 kaqChEevSas xOVWDY8qTIY YPXy3muVkEg rGVgjS98OsU o7grSsuFSS0 6OXbxfdAKDA h67BOdknVOc XUUyC6A6V4E JO-yZlbn4hM E0uLbeQlwjw bRu--9NwRtk lTxoFvVqDoo fCHWgOmpMvo 1wwOFE_N5V4 o0FkXRWpIA0 DUPMo2MCDn0 8EJYeUeGjyI qz0cQnbMdlk JFwzVrmyMZ8 AzdPPEZQOxo yy3ATmzyeIY 6IEvfA-0Y-w 3RjNTkTuQoM c1x-mUpvJGA aX7JHRmoRLA mgHcO2GqY2k vOCMJ8rokPE I1-jBnJTERE yFZWfNinXQE iKrO4ToKMRk `
